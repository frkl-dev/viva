# viva

A generic environment wrapper and (in the future) script interpreter.

This project is in very early alpha state, and its main purpose is to serve as a library for another project I'm working on, to be able to create Python environments dynamically. That being said, I think the pattern it encapsulates can be useful for other/similar circumstances, which is why it's published as a separate project.

## Current (known) issues

- no versioning support for packages
- applications are not run within an activated environment, so if a (conda) package depends on (for example) populated environment variables (like is done when activating such an environment), then it will fail
- updating environments with new specs sometimes leaves environments in an unusable state

## Usage

### Examples

```bash
# install the 'cookiecutter' package into the 'default' environment (if not already there)
viva -c conda-forge -s cookiecutter apply
# install the 'cookiecutter' package into an environment called 'cc' (if not already there), then run it
viva -e cc -c conda-forge -s cookiecutter run -- cookiecutter --help
```

### Environment specification

In *viva*, an environment can be specified in several different ways by the env-spec string. *viva* parses the string in teh following order, the first match will determine where the environment lives:

- if the string contains a (OS-specific) path separator (like `/` on Posix, '\' on Windows):
  - the string will be interpreted as relative or absolute path:
    - if that path points to an existing file, that file will be read and its content will interpreted as spec data for the environment
    - if that path points to an existing directory, or does not exist, the environment will be created in that directory
- if no path separator is found, and the string does not contain any characters except for alphanumeric characters and `_`:
  - the string will be interpreted as the environment alias, and the environment will be created under this alias in the (also OS-specific) user data directory

## Featrues (current & planned)
